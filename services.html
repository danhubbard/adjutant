        <p class="font-manrope mb-3">1. We meet and discuss the things you've noticed, or are concerned about. Some recent examples have been:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
          <li class="mb-2">The new “v3” of the product has been 'three weeks away' for six months and I don't know why it's not ready</li>
          <li class="mb-2">I’m just not seeing progress on the obvious things</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Our organic traffic has gone off a cliff, and nobody seems to know how to fix it</li>
          <li class="mb-2">What's being built and released doesn't align to the business' new growth strategy</li>
          <li class="mb-2">The product is buggy and we're rapidly running out of runway</li>
